# Deployment Strategy for Akka.NET Clusters

This overlay demonstrates using a Kubernetes **Deployment** instead of a **StatefulSet** for running Akka.NET clusters. This approach reduces rebalancing overhead during rolling updates at the cost of temporarily running n+1 pods.

## Key Differences from StatefulSet

### StatefulSet Approach (Base Configuration)
- **Pod Naming**: Stable, predictable names (pod-0, pod-1, pod-2)
- **DNS Addressing**: Uses DNS names like `pod-0.service-name`
- **Rolling Updates**: One pod at a time, reverse ordinal order
- **Rebalancing**: **2x per pod** - once when pod goes down, once when it comes back up

**Update Flow**:
```
1. Pod-2 terminates → Cluster rebalances to Pod-0, Pod-1
2. Pod-2 v2.0 starts → Cluster rebalances again (back to Pod-2)
3. Pod-1 terminates → Cluster rebalances to Pod-0, Pod-2
4. Pod-1 v2.0 starts → Cluster rebalances again (back to Pod-1)
Result: 6 rebalancing events for 3 pods (2x per pod)
```

### Deployment Approach (This Overlay)
- **Pod Naming**: Dynamic names (drawtogether-abc123, drawtogether-def456)
- **IP Addressing**: Uses pod IP addresses directly via `status.podIP`
- **Rolling Updates**: Surge strategy - new pods join before old pods leave
- **Rebalancing**: **1x per pod** - only when old pod leaves

**Update Flow**:
```
1. Pod-4 v2.0 starts → Joins cluster (now 4 pods total)
2. Pod-1 v1.0 terminates → Cluster rebalances once
3. Pod-5 v2.0 starts → Joins cluster (now 4 pods total)
4. Pod-2 v1.0 terminates → Cluster rebalances once
Result: 3 rebalancing events for 3 pods (1x per pod)
```

## Rolling Update Configuration

The key difference is in the deployment strategy:

```yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1        # Allow 1 extra pod during rollout
      maxUnavailable: 0  # Keep all pods available
```

This configuration:
- Starts a new pod with the new version **before** terminating any old pods
- Temporarily runs 4 pods instead of 3 (n+1)
- Old pods are only terminated after new pods are ready
- Reduces rebalancing overhead by **50%**

## Configuration Differences

### Environment Variables

**StatefulSet (DNS-based)**:
```yaml
- name: AkkaSettings__RemoteOptions__PublicHostname
  value: "$(POD_NAME).drawtogether"  # DNS name
```

**Deployment (IP-based)**:
```yaml
- name: POD_IP
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: status.podIP
- name: AkkaSettings__RemoteOptions__PublicHostname
  value: "$(POD_IP)"  # Direct IP address
```

### Service Configuration

Both approaches use a headless service (`clusterIP: None`) with `publishNotReadyAddresses: true` to enable Akka.Discovery.Kubernetes to find pods before they're fully ready.

## When to Use Deployment

Choose **Deployment** when:

1. **Frequent deployments** - CI/CD pipelines with multiple deployments per day
2. **Large clusters** - Rebalancing overhead is significant (many shards, heavy workloads)
3. **Dynamic environments** - Using Karpenter, spot instances, or node auto-scaling
4. **Cost tolerance** - Can accept temporary n+1 pods during updates (brief cost increase)
5. **Performance priority** - 50% reduction in rebalancing events justifies temporary resource overhead

## When to Use StatefulSet

Choose **StatefulSet** (base configuration) when:

1. **Stable DNS names** - Prefer predictable, stable pod names
2. **Infrequent deployments** - Updates are weekly or monthly
3. **Simple configuration** - Don't want to configure IP-based discovery
4. **Cost sensitive** - Cannot tolerate even temporary n+1 pods
5. **Seed node simplicity** - Easier to configure static seed nodes

## Real-World Production Feedback

From production Akka.NET users:

> "With StatefulSets, a pod gets removed then cluster load rebalances unnecessarily before it comes back up as a new version. With Deployments, it can surge an additional pod which the cluster knows is a higher version, so the rebalance doesn't happen onto the older pods."

This is especially important for:
- Heavy Akka.Cluster.Sharding workloads
- Clusters with large numbers of entities
- Applications where rebalancing causes noticeable latency spikes

## How to Deploy

### Using Kustomize

```bash
# Deploy using this overlay
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/deployment

# Or use the deployment scripts
cd k8s
./deployAll.ps1 -Overlay deployment
```

### Prerequisites

Same as StatefulSet approach:
1. Akka.Management with Kubernetes Discovery enabled
2. RBAC configured (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding)
3. TLS certificates created (if using Akka.Remote TLS)

```bash
# Create TLS secret
./create-tls-secret.ps1
```

## Monitoring Rolling Updates

Watch the rollout progress:

```bash
# Watch deployment rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/drawtogether -n drawtogether

# Watch pods during update
kubectl get pods -n drawtogether -w

# Check Akka.Cluster membership
kubectl logs -n drawtogether deployment/drawtogether -c drawtogether-app | grep "Member"
```

During updates, you'll see:
1. New pods joining the cluster (4 pods total)
2. Old pods leaving gracefully
3. Single rebalancing event per pod (vs. 2 for StatefulSet)

## Performance Impact

For a 3-replica cluster:

| Metric | StatefulSet | Deployment (Surge) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Rebalancing Events | 6 | 3 | 50% reduction |
| Peak Pod Count | 3 | 4 | +33% temporary |
| Update Duration | Longer | Shorter | ~30% faster |
| Latency Spikes | 6 events | 3 events | 50% fewer |

The trade-off:
- **Benefit**: 50% fewer rebalancing events = better user experience
- **Cost**: Temporary n+1 pods = brief increase in resource usage

## Troubleshooting

### Pods not forming cluster

Check Akka.Management logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n drawtogether deployment/drawtogether -c drawtogether-app | grep Management
```

Ensure:
- `POD_IP` environment variable is set correctly
- Akka.Discovery.Kubernetes is finding pods
- RBAC permissions are configured

### Rolling update stuck

Check deployment status:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment drawtogether -n drawtogether
```

Common issues:
- Readiness probe failing (pods not becoming ready)
- Resource constraints (can't schedule n+1 pods)
- Image pull errors

## Comparison to StatefulSet

| Feature | StatefulSet | Deployment (Surge) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Pod Names | Stable (pod-0, pod-1) | Dynamic (hash-based) |
| Addressing | DNS names | IP addresses |
| Rebalancing | 2x per pod | 1x per pod |
| Update Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Resource Usage | Consistent | Temporary spike |
| Rollback | Manual | Automatic |
| Best For | Stable workloads | Frequent updates |
